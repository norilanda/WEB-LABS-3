            <h3>Linkin Park</h3>
            <p>
                Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises
                vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell,
                DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark
                Wakefield and
                Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's
                earlier music
                spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop
                elements.
            </p>
            <p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, Hybrid Theory
                (2000), which
                became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the
                peak of
                the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles "One Step Closer",
                "Crawling" and
                "In the End" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to
                the
                nation's Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Meteora (2003), continued the band's success. The band
                explored
                experimental sounds on their third album, Minutes to Midnight (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin
                Park was
                among the most successful and popular rock acts.</p>

            <p>The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, A Thousand Suns
                (2010),
                layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, Living Things (2012), combined
                musical
                elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a
                heavier
                rock sound, and their seventh album, One More Light (2017), was their first pop-oriented record. Linkin
                Park
                went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington committed suicide in July 2017. In April 2022,
                Shinoda
                revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future.
